2.	**Exploratory Data Analysis:** Conducted comprehensive EDA to understand the dataset. Key steps included:
•	Summary Statistics: Computed summary statistics for numerical columns to grasp the data's overall characteristics.
•	Data Preprocessing: Divided the coordinates column into longitude and latitude components for better analysis. Addressed missing values in the "NUMBER OF DEAD" column by replacing them with zeros to ensure clean visualization.

3.	**Data Visualization:** Employed various visualization techniques to gain insights:
•	Histogram: Utilized histograms to depict the distribution of incidents across the years.
•	Bar Chart: Created bar charts to visualize the gender distribution among migrants.
•	Line Chart: Employed line charts to identify patterns and trends in the number of deceased migrants over the years and on a monthly basis.

4.	**Geospatial Visualization:** Enhanced understanding by plotting data points on a world map. This visualization method highlighted locations with significant numbers of deceased and missing migrants for improved spatial insights.
By combining these techniques, this project provides a comprehensive analysis of Global Missing Migrants' data, offering valuable insights into trends, patterns, and spatial distributions.
